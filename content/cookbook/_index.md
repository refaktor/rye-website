Here we will try to show practical information, recipes and examples of various subjects.

<!-- Programming languages are user interfaces, powerful, composable, scriptable, and the users might be specific, but still user interfaces. -->

<!-- As programming languages become higher and higher level, the border between programming languages and user interfaces will start blurring.
At a high level program could be seen as very flexible, composable, serializable user interface.

Program composition is a process of translating from computation verbiage and data structures to the problem domain verbiage and structures, and at the end the end-user verbiage.

In Rye we try to explore these things. For a language to be higher level than what we're used to it also needs higher level (closer to problem/human) data structures.  -->

<!-- Programming is translating from computer domain to user / problem domain (or reverse). Rye works closer to the user / problem domain. -->

<!-- Rye also tries to be a good tool for describing the problem, not just defining steps to solution. When the problem is well declared, working and improving the path to solution is easier. -->
